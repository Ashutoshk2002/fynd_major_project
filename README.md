# Problem Statement: 
Traditional college stationary shopping poses significant challenges for students. The reliance on cash or card payments, coupled with the inconvenience of vendor availability and the need to physically visit them on campus, creates a cumbersome process. Moreover, issues like uniform size mismatches require additional trips to the vendor. 


The campus photocopying queue further adds to the frustration. CollegeCrafters aims to address these challenges by introducing a digital platform that accepts various payment methods, ensures vendor availability at all times and provides an integrated zerox service. Our goal is to simplify the stationary shopping experience for college students, making it more efficient, convenient, and tailored to their unique needs.
